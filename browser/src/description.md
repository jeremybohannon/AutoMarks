## Description

For this assignment we will learn how to write basic functions in `Ruby`

A `function` can take multiple `inputs` and return one `output`.
Functions consist of a `signature` which is comprised of a `method name` and input `parameters`, and a `method body`.

### Example
```Ruby 
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
```
